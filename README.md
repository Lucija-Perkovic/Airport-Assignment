# Airport-Assignment
What I used:

1. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
2. PostgreSQL Database
3. Express.js Framework
4. AJAX/JQuery
5. https://www.datatables.net/
6. Google maps API

Things that are ok/aren't ok:

1. Scripts are in views not in Stylesheet. That's because I didn't want to separate them, I thought it would be easier if they were in the same file. 
2. I used different things for AJAX, including event.preventDefault(). I wanted it to be shown when someone enters their Airline or Airport. If someone entered a country which wasn't in Countries, I wanted that that person can see it.  
3. Countries are also in database
4. Entering names is case sensitive, which isn't good but I don't think it's neccessary for this type of assignment.


## HOW TO START IT? Type: node server.js
